Welcome to default's documentation!
===================================
The default plugin is a visual approach to let you create knob defaults inside Foundry's Nuke on the fly without the need to write and maintain any line of code.
It contains the default main window which lets you create, edit and delete knob defaults and bundle them in preset lists that can be imported and exported and thus be shared with other artists.
